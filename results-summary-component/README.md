## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got more practice in positioning items with CSS grid and Flexbox.

I also started learning to write CSS with a mobile-first workflow in order to improve my web page layout on mobile devices.

### Continued development

I aim to refine my techniques in positioning items on a web page by using CSS grid and Flexbox.
