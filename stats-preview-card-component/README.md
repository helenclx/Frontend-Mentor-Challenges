## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The new learning experience I had from solving this challenge is using the CSS `mix-blend-mode` property to blend an image with background color.

I got to practice using the CSS `order` property to set the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container, which is useful for responsive web layouts.

### Continued development

I could consider using CSS filters in my web design.
