## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The new thing I learned was to use the HTML `<picture>` element to specify using different images on diffrent device screen sizes.

I also got more practice in positioning items with CSS grid and Flexbox.

### Continued development

I aim to refine my techniques in positioning items on a web page by using CSS grid and Flexbox.
