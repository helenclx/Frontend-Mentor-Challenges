## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge has been a good exercise for aligning elements and ensuring the component look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

In particular, this CSS snippet will align an element to the center:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

This challenge has been a good exercise in practicing my HTML and CSS skills, and making a web page responsible.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Cheat Sheet](https://flexboxcheatsheet.com/) - This helped me for aligning elements by providing CSS snippets.
