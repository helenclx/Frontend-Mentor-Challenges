## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got more practice in using CSS Flexbox to structure my layout, as well as CSS `box-shadow` property to add drop shadow to my elements.

### Continued development

I aim to refine my techniques in positioning items on a web page by using CSS Flexbox.
