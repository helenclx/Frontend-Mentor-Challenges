## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got more practice in structuring a web page's layout with CSS grid and Flexbox, and designing the page's layout in a mobile-first workflow.

### Continued development

I aim to refine my techniques in positioning items on a web page by using CSS grid and Flexbox.
