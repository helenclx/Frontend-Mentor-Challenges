## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

The new thing I had learned was how to style radio buttons.

I got to practice setting up a form, using JavaScript to change a CSS property with the `element.style`, as well as making a web page interactive through JavaScript's `addEventListener()` method. The `change` event in particular is useful to update and register the input value.

I set up a variable and used `if...else` statement in JavaScript to prevent users from submitting without selecting their rating first.

In addition, I learned to practice the habit of using `console.log()` to check if my JavaScript functions are working as intended, amd cheking the console output in my web browser's developer tool.

### Continued development

I aim to practice my JavaScript skills more to make web pages interactive.
