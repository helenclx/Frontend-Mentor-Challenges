## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got to practice styling lists by using images as the list bullets. I also got more practice in form validation and form styling, including error messages.

### Continued development

I aim to practice form validation and design forms to be both stylish and accessible.
