## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to apply multiple backgrounds and position them in CSS.

I also got more practice in structuring a web page's layout with Flexbox.

### Continued development

I aim to refine my techniques in positioning items on a web page by using Flexbox.
